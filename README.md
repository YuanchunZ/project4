A car sign data set was selected, and the pictures were stored in the data folder. Through machine learning and feature extraction, the original feature set was compared, the feature set was reduced to 3 dimensions, and the feature set was reduced to 2 dimensions. Finally, the data set features were displayed on the coordinate axis through visualization.

The extracted original features were put into the train_feature.npy file, and a total of 34 category features were trained. Features reduced to 2 dimensions were put into train_Feature_reduction2.npy, and features reduced to 3 dimensions were put into train_Feature_reduction3.npy.
